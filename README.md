# TV MAZE POWERPUFF GIRLS - Bee Eng


## Why?


This project is part of the selection process for Front-End Developer sent by **Bee Eng**.


The challenge is to make an application that consumes information about the "Powerpuff Girls" TV Show from TVMaze Api and shows informations to the user.


## Some Observations about this App

1 - It was built on the basis of the `create-react-app`.

2 - Application state management was done using `React Redux`.

## Functionalities

- HomePage
  -  A list is rendered, containing information referring to the "Powerpuff Girls" TV show, which comes from the [TVMAZE API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api). Only the Image, Name, description and the list of episodes in the tv show are displayed to the user.
  -  When the user click on an episode, it is redirected to the episode details page.
 - Details Page
   - In the episode details screen, some other data that is not on the home page is rendered, such as image and description of the episode.
